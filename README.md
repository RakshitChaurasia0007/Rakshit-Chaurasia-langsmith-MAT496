# Rakshit-Chaurasia-langsmith-MAT496

This repository will include each and every detail of what I have learned and self reflected throughout my journey of learning Langsmith from basic.

This repository documents my learning journey with **LangSmith**, where I explore how to build, debug, and optimize LLM applications using tracing and other advanced tools.  

I have completed the initial **setup process**, including:  
- Setting up a Python virtual environment with all required dependencies.  
- Configuring API keys securely using a `.env` file.  
- Initializing Git and connecting the project to GitHub for version control.  

With the setup complete, I am now ready to begin the course and work through each **module and lesson**, capturing what I learn, the code I implement, and key takeaways along the way.

## Module 1 Deliverables

In this repository, I have uploaded the key newly created files from Module 1 along with their detailed reports. These files encapsulate all the core concepts and practical implementations covered in the lessons:

- **multilingual_rag_translation_chat.py**  
  A comprehensive multilingual translation chatbot using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), supporting Groq and OpenAI LLMs with tracing and interactive multi-turn chat.

- **interactive_tracing_chat.py**  
  An interactive demonstration of tracing methods applied to a chatbot scenario, integrating multiple LLM backends and showcasing detailed code observability via tracing decorators and context managers.

- **interactive_math_tutor.py**  
  A stepwise math problem solver chatbot providing explainable, step-by-step solutions. It includes dynamic prompt engineering, LLM model integration, tracing utilities, and runtime model switching.

Each file provides a self-contained example reflecting the lessons learned in Module 1, demonstrating setup, prompt engineering, tracing, retrieval augmentation, multi-model usage, and interactive conversational design.

Each of these files is accompanied by a separate detailed report within this repository. These reports cover:

- The lessons learned while working through each project.
- The modifications and enhancements made beyond the initial concepts.
- The key skills applied in building the projects, such as prompt engineering, tracing, multi-model integration, and interactive design.

This structure ensures a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of LangSmith and LLM applications, documented clearly for study and review.
